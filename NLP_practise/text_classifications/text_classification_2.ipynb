            "text/markdown": "> this has been an extraordinary year for australian films . \r\n \" shine \" has just scooped the pool at the australian film institute awards , picking up best film , best actor , best director etc . to that we can add the gritty \" life \" ( the anguish , courage and friendship of a group of male prisoners in the hiv-positive section of a jail ) and \" love and other catastrophes \" ( a low budget gem about straight and gay love on and near a university campus ) . \r\ni can't recall a year in which such a rich and varied celluloid library was unleashed from australia . \r\n \" shine \" was one bookend . \r\nstand by for the other one : \" dead heart \" . \r\n>from the opening credits the theme of division is established . \r\nthe cast credits have clear and distinct lines separating their first and last names . \r\nbryan | brown . \r\nin a desert settlement , hundreds of kilometres from the nearest town , there is an uneasy calm between the local aboriginals and the handful of white settlers who live nearby . \r\nthe local police officer has the task of enforcing \" white man's justice \" to the aboriginals . \r\nthese are people with a proud 40 , 000 year heritage behind them . \r\nnaturally , this includes their own system of justice ; key to which is \" payback \" . \r\nan eye for an eye . \r\nrevenge . \r\nusually extracted by the spearing through of the recipient's thigh . \r\nbrown , as the officer , manages quite well to keep the balance . \r\nhe admits that he has to 'bend the rules' a bit , including actively encouraging at least one brutal \" payback \" . \r\n ( be warned that this scene , near the start , is not for the squeamish ) . \r\nthe local priest - an aboriginal , but in the \" white fellas \" church - has a foot on either side of the line . \r\nhe is , figuratively and literally , in both camps . \r\nernie dingo brings a great deal of understanding to this role as the man in the middle . \r\nhe is part churchman and part politician . \r\nhowever the tension , like the heat , flies and dust , is always there . \r\nwhilst her husband - the local teacher - is in church , white lady kate ( milliken ) and her aborginal friend tony , ( pedersen ) have gone off into the hills . \r\nhe takes her to a sacred site , even today strictly men-only . \r\nshe appears to not know this . \r\ntony tells her that this is a special place , an initiation place . \r\nhe then makes love to her , surrounded by ancient rock art . \r\nthe community finds out about this sacrilegious act and it's payback time . \r\nthe fuse is lit and the brittle inter-racial peace is shattered . \r\neveryone is affected in the fall out . \r\nto say more is to give away the details of this finely crafted film . \r\nsuffice to say it's a rewarding experience . \r\nbryan brown , acting and co-producing , is the pivotal character . \r\nhis officer is real , human and therefore flawed . \r\nbrown comments that he expects audiences to feel warmth towards the man , then suddenly feel angry about him . \r\nit wasn't long ago that i visited central australia - ayers rock ( uluru ) and alice springs - for the first time . \r\nthe wide-screen cinematography shows the dead heart of australia in a way that captures it's vicious beauty , but never deteriorates into a moving slide show , in which the gorgeous background dominates those pesky actors in the foreground . \r\nthe cultural clash has provided the thesis for many a film ; from the western to the birdcage . \r\nat least three excellent australian films have covered the aboriginal people and the line between them and we anglo-saxon 'invaders' : \" jedda \" , \" the chant of jimmie blacksmith \" and \" the last wave \" . \r\nin a year when the race 'debate' has reared up in australia , it is nourishing to see such an intelligent , non-judgemental film as \" dead heart \" . \r\nthe aboriginal priest best sums this up . \r\nhe is asked to say if he is a \" black fella or white fella \" . \r\n"
